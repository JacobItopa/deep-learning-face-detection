Thanks for downloading my free Tattoo Set 2 For V4!


You will need Photoshop or any other program that can handle PSD files.

Load your favourite V4 Torso texture and then the V4TattooSet1.psd file.

Resize either your texture or the PSD file so that both are the same size.

Copy the texture into V4TattooSet2.

You can turn the individual layers on or off.

Save your new texture.

In Poser choose your texture in the material room for V4´s Torso and Hip.

With a bit of extra work you will be able to use the tattoos with any texture for any character, or reposition it on the V4 texture.

Have fun!
